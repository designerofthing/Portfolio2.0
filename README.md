## About this project
This project was a solo project by https://github.com/designerofthing.

It is a portfolio application to showcase my work as well as ReactJS skills.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The project is styled without a CSS framework, just custom CSS.  
All images are hosted via AWS S3, CD is via Netlify and CI via Semaphore.  

The application's features are tested using Cypress.

## Dependencies
To run locally you will need to install the packages in the package.json using a package manager for JavaScript.
On top of the packages from the bootstrap we are also using:
